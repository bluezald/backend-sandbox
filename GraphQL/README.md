# GraphQL
- GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

- In a system like REST, you can only pass a single set of arguments - the query parameters and URL segments in your request. But in GraphQL, every field and nested object can get its own set of arguments, making GraphQL a complete replacement for making multiple API fetches. You can even pass arguments into scalar fields, to implement data transformations once on the server, instead of on every client separately.

```js
{
  human(id: "1000") {
    name
    height(unit: FOOT)
  }
}
```
- Returns
```json
{
  "data": {
    "human": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker",
      "height": 5.6430448
    }
  }
}
```
